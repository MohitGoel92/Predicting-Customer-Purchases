# Predicting Customer Purchases

**Task:**

We currently work within the data science team of an automotive company, who subsidises electric eco-friendly cars to companies. For one of our clients, the company has sent across employee data and whether they have put an order through. Our task is to see whether we can see any trends and produce a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer is likely to purchase the car.   


We will be completing this business task using Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Classification Trees and XGBoost.
