# Predicting Customer Purchases

**Task:**

We currently work within the data science team of an automotive company, who subsidises electric eco-friendly cars to companies. For one of our clients, the company has sent across employee data and whether they have put an order through. Our task is to see whether we can see any trends and produce a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer is likely to purchase the car.   

We will be completing this business task using Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Classification Trees and XGBoost.

## Logistic Regression

**Pros of Logistic Regression:**
- Probabilistic approach
- Gives information about statistical significance of features

**Cons of Logistic Regression:**

- Logistic Regression assumptions

**Assumptions of the Logistic Regression:**
- Appropriate outcome structure (Binary logistic regression requires a binary dependent variable, and an ordinal logistic regression requires an ordinal dependent variable)
- Observation independence (The observations are independent of each other)
- Lack of multicollinearity (The independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other)
- Linearity of independent variables and log odds (The independent variables are linearly related to the log odds)
- Large sample size
